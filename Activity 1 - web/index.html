    <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. It has a muscular,
        broad-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually
        dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming
        groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female
        lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator;
        although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, the species typically
        does not actively seek out and prey on humans.</p>
